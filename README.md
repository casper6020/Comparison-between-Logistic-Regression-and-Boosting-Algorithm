# Introduction
Often times, data scientists and researchers lean to advanced machine learning models because of their prediction power. We would like to explore how traditional statistical model like logistic regressions performs against different boosting algorithms. Instead of focusing on prediction power alone, we also need to consider the domain, objective and interpretability.
